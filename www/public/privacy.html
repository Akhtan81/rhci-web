                            <p>This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how Nur Pacific Star LLC ("Nur Pacific Star
                                LLC", "we", "us" or "our") collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable
                                information ("Personal Information") you ("User", "you" or "your") may provide in the
                                TaBee mobile application and any of its products or services
                                (collectively, "Mobile Application" or "Services"). It also describes the choices
                                available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access
                                and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies
                                that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>

                            <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>

                            <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an
                                account, publish content, make a purchase, fill any online forms in the Mobile
                                Application. When required this information may include your email address, name, phone
                                number, address, credit card information, bank information, or other Personal
                                Information. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may
                                not be able to take advantage of some of the Mobile Application's features. Users who
                                are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.</p>

                            <h2>Collection of non-personal information</h2>

                            <p>When you open the Mobile Application our servers automatically record information that
                                your device sends. This data may include information such as your device's IP address
                                and location, device name and version, operating system type and version, language
                                preferences, information you search for in our Mobile Application, access times and
                                dates, and other statistics.</p>

                            <h2>Managing personal information</h2>

                            <p>You are able to access, add to, update and delete certain Personal Information about you.
                                The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Mobile Application or
                                Services change. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the
                                unrevised information in our records. Some information may remain in our private records
                                after your deletion of such information from your account. We will retain and use your
                                information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
                                enforce our agreements. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating
                                your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would
                                identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall
                                be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
                                rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration
                                of the retention period.</p>

                            <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>

                            <p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used to personalize your experience;
                                improve our Mobile Application; improve customer service and respond to queries and
                                emails of our customers; process transactions; send notification emails such as password
                                reminders, updates, etc; run and operate our Mobile Application and Services.
                                Non-Personal Information collected is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and
                                establish statistical information regarding Mobile Application traffic and usage. This
                                statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify
                                any particular user of the system.</p>

                            <p>We may process Personal Information related to you if one of the following applies: (i)
                                You have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note that under some
                                legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
                                processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the
                                following legal bases below. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of
                                Personal Information is subject to European data protection law; (ii) Provision of
                                information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any
                                pre-contractual obligations thereof; (ii) Processing is necessary for compliance with a
                                legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to a task that is
                                carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
                                us; (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by
                                us or by a third party. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal
                                basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of
                                Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to
                                enter into a contract.</p>

                            <h2>Information transfer and storage</h2>

                            <p>Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your

                                countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your
                                information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the

                            <h2>The rights of users</h2>

                            <p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In
                                particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw
                                consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of your
                                information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if
                                the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the
                                right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding
                                certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing
                                processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask
                                for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances,
                                to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your
                                information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under
                                certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii)
                                you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and

                                thereof.</p>

                            <h2>The right to object to processing</h2>

                            <p>Where Personal Information is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an
                                official authority vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued
                                by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground related to your
                                particular situation to justify the objection. You must know that, however, should your
                                Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object to that
                                processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether we are
                                processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the
