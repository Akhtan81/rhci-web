                    If you’re like a lot of people who want to recycle more, you may have a lot of things you’d love to recycle or donate, but you just don’t have time. There may not even be a recycling center near your house! 

                    Got any old furniture sitting around, or home appliances you’re not using anymore just gathering dust? Do you have documents stacking up that you know you need to shred, but just haven’t gotten around to it? Maybe you even have some things you would like to donate, but you haven’t been able to get in contact with any of the charity groups in your area?

                        We believe so many things in the world can be used for recycling, and be repurposed, instead of ending up in a landfill. We want to bring together people from all over who are advocates and want to help protect local ecology. We don’t want to bring only customers to our network, but also commercial businesses non-profit organization partners who can help us achieve our goal for the community!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For customers who use our app, we intend to offer incentive prizes. For participating in our program and helping us do our part to help the environment, you may get a bonus reward from a local business (like a movie ticket to your local cinema)!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When you use our app, not only are you going to be saving yourself time and money on handling your recyclables, you’re also going to be helping your local environment! TaBee is dedicated to working as hard as bees to make sure we do our part to the planet.

                    Using Tabee, both customers, as well as local businesses, can get in on the recycling action with TaBee. Our dedication and vision to do everything we can to help the environment will need all the help we can get, and our TaBee customers and business partners are the biggest parts of helping us realize that vision!
