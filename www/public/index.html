                    What if you could contribute to a noble cause and help with the preservation of the environment?
                    What if there was a
                    system designed around this very idea to help you be environmentally friendly and recycle, but you
                    just don’t have the
                    time or the energy to take your recyclables to a recycling center? What if there isn’t a recycling

                    you still want to do
                    your recycling so you have peace of mind, knowing you’re doing your part to help keep the Earth free
                    of pollution and

                        your recyclables into canisters, bags, tubs, etc. You have to pack all these containers up into
                        your vehicle, and you have to find your nearest recycling center (if there is even one in your
                        town). Then you have to stand in line, wait, and then have your recyclables weighed.</p>

                                    All you have to do is collect your recyclables, and when you have them ready to go,
                                    just log onto the app and let us know you are ready for us to come collect it. When
                                    our driver partner arrives at your house, they will weigh your recyclables on the
                                    scales that are equipped in their truck. You can get paid one of two methods that
                                    are up to you--good old-fashioned cash, or bank transfer straight to your account!
