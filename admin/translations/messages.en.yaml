      <p>Remember when Taxi service app completely took over the rideshare industry? With the release of their mobile app and a simple concept that allows anyone to use their car to make money helping others looking for rides, they upended the taxi industry and became a game-changer. Here at

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>

      <p>Simple! You, as a prospective driver partner with Mobile Recycling Systems, can sign up right here at
          &nbsp;<a href="https://admin.mobilerecycling.net">admin.mobilerecycling.net</a>&nbsp;
          as a partner. You’ll choose the area you want to collect for, and await confirmation for your request.
      </p>

      <p>A client will register on our mobile app where they will enter their personal data such as address, phone number, and email, and also data for conducting an online transaction for cash rewards. Once the client collects a minimum amount of recyclables, they will send a request through the app for pickup of their recyclables. This request and all information pertaining to it will come straight to your personal account. Once you have accumulated a sufficient number of applications, you can go collect the recyclable materials from your clients!</p>

      <p>The clients will have a choice of how they will like to be paid for the collected materials--either in good-old fashioned cash, or through bank transfer through our integrated payment system in the mobile app.</p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold font-italic">You set your own price and minimum quantity of raw materials!</p>

      <p>You can choose an area by ZIP code for collecting recyclables. The site administrator will approve your request, or offer you other options. Our collector partners pay an annual or monthly fee for use of the app, and the amount will be set after a free one month trial period.</p>
